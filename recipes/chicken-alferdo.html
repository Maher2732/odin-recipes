<h6>A lot of the recipes I see that are worthwhile are too much work because you have to make your own sauce, and those that don't have you make your own have no flavor. This recipe shows you how to take plain, bland, store-made sauce and make it more than restaurant-worthy.</h6>

   <p>Creamy chicken Alfredo is a classic Italian-American dish that combines tender pieces of chicken with a rich and velvety Alfredo sauce, served over a bed of pasta. The sauce, made from a luxurious blend of butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, coats the pasta and chicken, creating a comforting and indulgent meal. Often enhanced with garlic, black pepper, and sometimes a hint of nutmeg, the dish balances the savory flavors perfectly. Freshly chopped parsley and grated Parmesan on top add a finishing touch, making creamy chicken Alfredo a beloved favorite for both weeknight dinners and special occasions</p> 
<ul>ingredinets
    <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 (16 ounce) packages thin spaghetti</li>
    <li>4 (15 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
    <li>½ tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups shredded Parmesan cheese </li>
    
    
    <ol>instructions
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook thin spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken along with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. Bring to a slight boil; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Add broccoli to sauce.        </li>
        <li>Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.</li>
    </ol>
