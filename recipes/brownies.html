<p> Gooey brownies are a decadent dessert, loved for their rich, fudgy texture and intense chocolate flavor. Unlike their cakey counterparts, gooey brownies boast a moist, dense interior that almost melts in your mouth. The secret to achieving this luscious consistency lies in the perfect balance of ingredients, including high-quality chocolate, butter, and just the right amount of flour. Often topped with a crackly crust, these indulgent treats are best enjoyed warm, possibly with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a drizzle of caramel sauce, making them an irresistible delight for chocolate lovers.</p>  
 <ui>ingredinets
 <li>5 tablespoons (71 grams) unsalted butter</li>
 <li>1 1/4 cups (249 grams) granulated sugar</li>
 <li>2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, cold</li>
 <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
 <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
 <li>3/4 cup (75 grams) cocoa powder</li>
 <li>1/2 cup (63 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
 <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
 <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
 <li>3/4 cup (128 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
</ui>
<ol> instructions
 <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Line an 8 by 8-inch light-colored metal pan with foil or parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
 <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and sugar. Microwave for about 1 minute, or until the butter is melted. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in the oil and cocoa powder.</li>   
 <li>With a rubber spatula, stir in the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>   
 <li>Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the brownies are set and a cake tester inserted into the center has moist crumbs attached. Do not overcook. Let cool completely to solidify before cutting and serving.</li>   
 <li>Brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Brownies will be gooey when served warm, chewy when served at room temperature, and fudgy when served chilled.</li>
